<h3>Question: Add at least 3 Project features</h3>  
<p>I'm talking about local features here like the search button, local storage, and rechart.</p>
<li> 
    <small>search button: I have implemented in such a way that when a user comes to my website and clicks on the category name, the data of that category will be shown in the ui.</small>
</li>
</br>
<li>
    <small>local storage: When I go to the home page in the banner section below, 12 cards are shown called homeCards and if I click on the card, it will take me to a different route and there is a button called donate. </br> Donation page I made payment in such a way that when someone goes to see the single details of the card, if he clicks on the donate button, the data will automatically go to the donation page and I have made this full payment through local storage. </small>
</li>
</br>
<li>
    <small>Rechart: I have installed the Rechart package and first of all I have loaded all the data using Statistics page using useDataLoader and loaded the data from local storage. Here I have loaded two types of data, the first is the total data and the second is the local storage data. By comparing between I have shown Rechart on the display</small>
